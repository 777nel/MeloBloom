		<h1 class="goal_heads">Why MeloBloom?</h1>
		<p class="reasoning">
			It has been proven that music can act as a method of relief and is a
			catalyst to help soothe your nerves and let you wind down. Studies found
			that 75% of people feel less stressed when listening to their favorite
			song, and 50% of people are more productive whilst listening to music. The
			effects music has on the mind and body are positive, and as depicted in an
			experiment by a group of Finnish researchers. Patients with music therapy
			had a lower depression score after 6 months than in psychotherapy alone!
